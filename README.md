# geop_nn
In this project we used dense and convolutional encoder-decoder neural networks to try and predict geopotential fields for 7 days in advance. 
We used global reanalysis ERA5 daily data for years 1950 till 2021. For test data only 2021 was used. The results of RMSE and Accuracy are presented in 
graphs:
